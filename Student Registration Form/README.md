##  Core Logic Concept

- All student data is stored as **JavaScript objects**
- Registration data is saved inside an **array in LocalStorage**
- Logged-in user data is stored separately for session handling
- DOM is used only for **rendering UI**
- Authentication logic is separated from UI logic

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Student fills up the registration form
2. Data is stored in `localStorage` as `userData`
3. Student logs in using **Student ID & Password**
4. Valid credentials create a login session
5. Logged-in student data is displayed on the dashboard
6. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page
