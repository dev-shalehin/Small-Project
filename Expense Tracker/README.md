##  Expense Tracker Application

A clean, simple, **Expense Tracker Application** built with **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This app helps users track **income and expenses dynamically** and automatically indicates when expenses exceed income.

---

##  Features

- ➕ Add income dynamically
- ➖ Add expenses with title & category
- 🔄 Automatic total calculation
- ⚠️ Shows negative (`-`) sign when expense exceeds income
- 🔁 Expense display auto-updates when income changes
- 🧠 Clean logic with separated calculation & UI
- 📱 Beginner-friendly & scalable structure

---

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **DOM Manipulation**

---



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Core Logic Concept

- Income and Expense are stored as **pure numbers**
- DOM is used only for **display**
- A single `updateSummary()` function keeps UI always in sync
- Prevents calculation bugs and improves maintainability

---

##  How It Works

1. User adds income
2. User adds expenses
3. If **Expense > Income**, expense value shows `-`
4. When income increases again, the `-` sign is removed automatically
5. UI always stays updated without page reload

---

##  Future Improvements

-  LocalStorage support
-  Monthly expense charts
-  Category-based filtering
-  Dark mode
-  Fully responsive UI
