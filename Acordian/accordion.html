              Learning UI/UX design requires a mix of theory, practice, and
              real-world examples. Start by understanding the basic principles
              of design such as color theory, typography, spacing, and visual
              hierarchy. Then move on to UX fundamentals like user research,
              wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use tools like Figma or Adobe XD to practice designing
              interfaces. Most importantly, analyze popular apps and websites to
              understand why certain design choices work well for users.
